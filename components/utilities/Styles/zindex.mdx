# Z-Index Styles

Here you can find a collection of global utility styles for z-indexes.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

These can be imported into your [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) manifest like so:

```scss
@import '~@unitedincome/components/dist/zindex';
```

These variables can also be utilized in JavaScript.

```javascript
import {zindex} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

You can use each z-index either via a Sass or JavaScript variable or you can use a provided helper class. You can view some common use cases for these values below.

    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Value</th>

  <tr>
    <td>z-index-below</td>

    <td>-1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>z-index-auto</td>
    <td>
      Auto should be used if an element needs a z-index value but you don't want
