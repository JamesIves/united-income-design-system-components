# ArrowIcon

The ArrowIcon component creates an arrow icon using inline SVG.


## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import ArrowIcon from '@unitedincome/components/dist/ArrowIcon'
```

```javascript
import {ArrowIcon} from '@unitedincome/components'
```


## Example ðŸš€

```javascript
<ArrowIcon fill="#000" height="2rem" width="2rem" />
```

## Animating

If you'd like to apply an animation to the arrow icon you can do so with CSS by transitioning on `transform`. An example of this would look something like this:

```css
.arrow-icon {
  transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

```javascript
<ArrowIcon className="arrow-icon" fill="#000" height="2rem" width="2rem" />
```
