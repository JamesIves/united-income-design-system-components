# ArrowIcon Component

The ArrowIcon component creates an arrow icon using inline SVG.

## Example ðŸš€

```javascript
<ArrowIcon fill="#000" height="20" width="20" />
```

## Animating

If you'd like to apply an animation to the arrow icon you can do so with CSS by transitioning on `transform`. An example of this would look something like this:

```css
.arrow-icon {
  transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

```javascript
<ArrowIcon className="arrow-icon" fill="#000" height="20" width="20" />
```
