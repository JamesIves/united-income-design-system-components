## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import ItemizationBox from '@unitedincome/components/dist/ItemizationBox';
```

```javascript
import {ItemizationBox} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <ItemizationBox
    label="Expense Totals"
    values={[
      {
        label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
        value: 900000,
      },
      {
        label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
        value: 200,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
    ]}
  />
</Preview>

```javascript
<ItemizationBox
  label="Expense Totals"
  values={[
    {
      label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
      value: 900000,
    },
    {
      label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
      value: 200,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
  ]}
/>
```

### Adding a Tooltip

If an itemization requires some additional details you can provide it with a `tooltip` prop. This will allow you to enter a label, and some additional information that will display when it's hovered.

<Preview>
  <ItemizationBox
    label="Expense Totals"
    values={[
      {
        label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
        value: -900000,
      },
      {
        label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
        value: 200,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
        tooltip: {
          label: 'Cat Facts',
          description: 'Montezuma is the best cat in the world!',
        },
      },
    ]}
  />
</Preview>

```javascript
<ItemizationBox
  label="Expense Totals"
  values={[
    {
      label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
      value: -900000,
    },
    {
      label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
      value: 200,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
      tooltip: {
        label: 'Cat Facts',
        description: 'Montezuma is the best cat in the world!',
      },
    },
  ]}
/>
```

### Collapsing

You can toggle the collapsed state of the component using the `isCollapsed` prop. Once toggled this will animate the itemizations below the summary.

<Preview>
  <ItemizationBox
    label="Expense Totals"
    values={[
      {
        label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
        value: 900000,
      },
      {
        label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
        value: 200,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
    ]}
    isCollapsed={true}
  />
</Preview>

```javascript
<ItemizationBox
  label="Expense Totals"
  values={[
    {
      label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
      value: 900000,
    },
    {
      label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
      value: 200,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
  ]}
  isCollapsed={true}
/>
```

### Navigation Link

You can display an optional navigation link below the itemization box when it's not in its collapsed state by passing in a `buttonOptions` prop.

<Preview>
  <ItemizationBox
    label="Expense Totals"
    values={[
      {
        label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
        value: 900000,
      },
      {
        label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
        value: 200,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
      {
        label:
          'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
        value: 600,
      },
    ]}
    buttonOptions={{
      label: 'View All Cats',
      path: 'https://jamesiv.es',
    }}
  />
</Preview>

```javascript
<ItemizationBox
  label="Expense Totals"
  values={[
    {
      label: 'Montezumas Cat Food',
      value: 900000,
    },
    {
      label: 'Spice 6 Palak Paneer',
      value: 200,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
    {
      label:
        'Things that I really should not spend my money on but I do because I do not really care is this long enough yet because I want a really long title',
      value: 600,
    },
  ]}
  buttonOptions={{
    label: 'View All Cats',
    path: 'https://jamesiv.es',
  }}
/>
```
