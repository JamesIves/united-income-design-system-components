# QuestionCard

This component renders a question card for the Hogwarts/McGonagall flow. This card is typically used when you need to combine multiple question types in a single card.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import QuestionCard from '@unitedincome/components/dist/QuestionCard';
```

```javascript
import {QuestionCard} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <QuestionCard
    title="Montezuma is a great cat"
    description="He is indeed."
    shortTitle="Monte"
    onSubmit={() => alert('Submitted!')}
  />
</Preview>

```javascript
<QuestionCard
  title="Montezuma is a great cat"
  description="He is indeed."
  onSubmit={() => alert('Submitted!')}
/>
```

### Using in a McGonagall Flow

You can use the `QuestionCard` component in a McGonagall flow using the following pattern.

```javascript
export const renderCard = (props, state) => {
  return <QuestionCard {...props} />;
};
```

### Adding a Summary

The `QuestionCard` component does not automatically keep track of the questions placed within it. Because of this you'll need to provide the `QuestionCard` component with a `summary` prop. Depending on the questions being asked it may be appropriate to use either a [FormSummary](?path=/docs/molecules-formsummary--default) or a [SimpleSummary](?path=/docs/molecules-simplesummary--default).

### Text Styles

Because the `QuestionCard` can render arbitrary content, you may need to apply text styles to your elements. You can find a series of helper classes [here](/?path=/story/utilities-styles--typography).
