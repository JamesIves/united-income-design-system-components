# Card Shell Component

This component is a flexible shell for the McGonagall card. See if any of the other card components better suit your need before using this one.

## Example ðŸš€

```javascript
export const renderCard = (props, state) => {
  return <CardShell {...props}>Some card content</CardShell>;
};
```

### To Use With Hogwarts 1.0

This will work similar to the existing Hogwarts Screen components, just set container to CardShell

```javascript
<Hogwarts.Screen name="birthday" transitions="gender" container={CardShell} />
```

## Best Practices

If you're making a component that will extend past the edges of the card similar to the ExpandCollapse, you will need to add a css animation to make that element appear after the card is finished animating because of the `overflow: hidden` the card uses while animating.

Here's an example of how it was applied in the ExpandCollapse component

```
.uic--mcgonagall-card {
  .uic--ec-controls-wrapper {
    transform: scale(0);
  }

  &.uic--animation-ended {
    .uic--ec-controls-wrapper {
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: 1s cubic-bezier(0.18, 0.89, 0.35, 2.05) transform;
    }
  }
}
```

## Behaviors

### Disabled Submit Button

The card iterates through its children to see if there are any invalid fields. If it finds any invalid fields, the Submit button will get disabled. On the third click of the disabled continue button, a message will show above the button saying "You must answer this question before hitting continue.", it will highlight empty required fields, and will scroll you up to the first invalid field. On the fourth click and every other click after that, it will shake the message to reinforce that the question must be answered first.
