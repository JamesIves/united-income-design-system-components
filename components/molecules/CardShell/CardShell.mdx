# CardShell

This component is a flexible card shell primarily used for McGonagall cards. This component typically wraps other card types.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import CardShell from '@unitedincome/components/dist/CardShell';
```

```javascript
import {CardShell} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

<Preview>
  <CardShell>Some card content</CardShell>
</Preview>

```javascript
<CardShell>Some card content</CardShell>
```

### Elements that extend past the card

If you're making a component that will extend past the edges of the card similar to the ExpandCollapse, you will need to add a css animation to make sure that the elements that appear after the card have finished animating. This is because of the `overflow: hidden` property the card uses while animating.

Here's an example of how it was applied in the `ExpandCollapse` component

```css
.uic--mcgonagall-card-shell {
  .uic--ec-controls-wrapper {
    transform: scale(0);
  }

  &.uic--animation-ended {
    .uic--ec-controls-wrapper {
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: 1s cubic-bezier(0.18, 0.89, 0.35, 2.05) transform;
    }
  }
}
```

### Disabled Submit Button

The card iterates through its children to see if there are any invalid fields. If it finds any invalid fields, the submit button will become disabled. On the third click of the disabled continue button, a message will show above the button saying `You must answer this question before hitting continue.`, it will highlight empty required fields, and will scroll you up to the first invalid field. On the fourth click and every other click after that, it will shake the message to reinforce that the question must be answered first.

<Preview>
  <CardShell
    disabled={true}
    hasError={true}
    forceUnansweredQuestionError={true}
  >
    Some card content
  </CardShell>
</Preview>

```javascript
<CardShell disabled={true} hasError={true} forceUnansweredQuestionError={true}>
  Some card content
</CardShell>
```
