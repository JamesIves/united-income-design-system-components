# Cabinet

The Cabinet component (also known as the Vanishing Cabinet) generates a cabinet pullout which appears on the right side of the screen. By default the Cabinet is controlled using your own state to handle the opening and closing.

## Importing ðŸ“¦

You can use this component using one of the following import patterns.

```javascript
import Cabinet from '@unitedincome/components/dist/Cabinet';
```

```javascript
import {Cabinet} from '@unitedincome/components';
```

## Example ðŸš€

```javascript
<Cabinet
  name="cabinet"
  show={this.state.show}
  label="Open Cabinet"
  toggle={() => this.setState({show: !this.state.show})}
>
  <h2>Montezuma is the best cat</h2>
  <p>You can place a paragraph about how good of a cat he is here</p>
  <h2>This is why</h2>
  <p>
    Because he just is
    <sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <footer>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Montezuma is the best cat in the world. Any claim that doesn't state
        this is false and should be disregarded.
      </li>
      <li>This is another thing</li>
    </ol>
  </footer>
</Cabinet>
```

### Using `handleWithState`

If you're including the Cabinet once on the page you can use the `handleWithState` prop to disable the `show` and `toggle` props, allowing the Cabinet component to manage its own state. This will make it so the Cabinet can _only_ be activated through the label, which may not be appropriate for all use cases.

<Preview>
  <Cabinet label="Open Cabinet" handleWithState={true}>
    <h2>Montezuma is the best cat</h2>
    <p>You can place a paragraph about how good of a cat he is here</p>
    <h2>This is why</h2>
    <p>
      Because he just is
      <sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <footer>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Montezuma is the best cat in the world. Any claim that doesn't state
          this is false and should be disregarded.
        </li>
        <li>This is another thing</li>
      </ol>
    </footer>
  </Cabinet>
</Preview>

```javascript
<Cabinet name="cabinet" label="Open Cabinet" handleWithState={true}>
  <h2>Montezuma is the best cat</h2>
  <p>You can place a paragraph about how good of a cat he is here</p>
  <h2>This is why</h2>
  <p>
    Because he just is
    <sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <footer>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Montezuma is the best cat in the world. Any claim that doesn't state
        this is false and should be disregarded.
      </li>
      <li>This is another thing</li>
    </ol>
  </footer>
</Cabinet>
```
