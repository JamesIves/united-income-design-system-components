# Cabinet Component

The Cabinet component generates a cabinet pullout which appears on the right side of the screen. By default the Cabinet is controlled using your own state to handle the opening and closing.

## Example ðŸš€

```javascript
<Cabinet
  name="cabinet"
  show={this.state.show}
  label={<div>Open Cabinet</div>}
  toggle={() => this.setState({show: !this.state.show})}
>
  <h2>Montezuma is the best cat</h2>
  <p>You can place a paragraph about how good of a cat he is here</p>
  <h2>This is why</h2>
  <p>Because he just is</p>
</Cabinet>
```

## Using `handleWithState`

If you're including the Cabinet once on the page you can use the `handleWithState` prop to disable the `show` and `toggle` props, allowing the Cabinet component to manage its own state. This will make it so the Cabinet can _only_ be activated through the label, which may not be appropriate for all use cases.

```javascript
<Cabinet name="cabinet" label={<div>Open Cabinet</div>} handleWithState={true}>
  <h2>Montezuma is the best cat</h2>
  <p>You can place a paragraph about how good of a cat he is here</p>
  <h2>This is why</h2>
  <p>Because he just is</p>
</Cabinet>
```

## Label Styling

In order to keep the label styling consistent you can pass in a Button component like so:

````javascript
            <Cabinet
              label={
                <Button variant="link" light>
                  {moreDetails.label}
                </Button>
              }
              visibleInPrint={false}
              header="Learn more about Montezuma"
              handleWithState>
                <p>
                  I'm not sure why Monte is the best? He just is
                </p>
              </Cabinet>
              ```
````
